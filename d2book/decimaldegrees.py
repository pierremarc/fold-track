DESCRIPTION

DecimalDegrees module provides functions to convert between
degrees/minutes/seconds and decimal degrees.

Inspired by Walter Mankowski's Geo::Coordinates::DecimalDegrees module
for Perl, originally located in CPAN Archives:
http://search.cpan.org/~waltman/Geo-Coordinates-DecimalDegrees-0.05/

doctest examples are based following coordinates:
DMS: 121 8' 6"
DM: 121 8.1'
DD: 121.135

To run doctest units just execut this module script as follows
(-v instructs Python to run script in verbose mode):

$ python decimaldegrees.py [-v]

    only degrees (1st element of returned list) will be negative,
    minutes (2nd element) and seconds (3rd element) will always be positive.
